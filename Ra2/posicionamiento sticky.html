                    Of course, I can help you with that. Based on the code you
                    provided, the CSS for the header is actually correct. The
                    `position: fixed;` property is what you need to make an
                    element stick to the top of the viewport. The issue you're
                    likely seeing is that the content of the is partially hidden
                    *behind* the fixed header. ### The Explanation When you set
                    `position: fixed;` on an element, it is taken out of the
                    normal flow of the document. This means the next element in
                    the HTML (your ``) behaves as if the header isn't there and
                    starts from the very top of the page, causing the overlap.
                    While you have a `margin-top: 40px;` on your `section`, the
                    header's height might be larger than that, still causing
                    some of the content to be obscured. ### The Solution The
                    common practice to solve this is to add padding to the top
                    of the to push all the content down by an amount equal to or
                    greater than the height of the fixed header.

                <p>
                    Ah, I see the issue now. Thank you for clarifying. You're
                    right, the with the `sticky` class is appearing on top of
                    the `header` when you scroll. This happens because of
                    something called the "stacking context." When you use
                    `position: sticky` or `position: fixed`, you create a new
                    stacking context, and by default, elements that appear later
                    in the HTML will be rendered on top of elements that appear
                    earlier. ### The Explanation Both your and your `.sticky`
                    are taken out of the normal document flow in a way. Without
                    a specified stacking order, the browser renders the
                    `.sticky` element on top because it comes after the ` in the
                    document. ### The Solution To fix this, you need to tell the
                    browser which element should be on top by giving the a
                    higher `z-index`. The `z-index` property controls the
                    vertical stacking order of elements. An element with a
                    greater `z-index` will always be in front of an element with
                    a lower one. Here is the corrected CSS for your `header`

                    header's height might be larger than that, still causing
                    some of the content to be obscured. ### The Solution The
                    common practice to solve this is to add padding to the top
                    of the to push all the content down by an amount equal to or
                    greater than the height of the fixed header.

                    Of course, I can help you with that. Based on the code you
                    provided, the CSS for the header is actually correct. The
                    `position: fixed;` property is what you need to make an
                    element stick to the top of the viewport. The issue you're
                    likely seeing is that the content of the is partially hidden
                    *behind* the fixed header. ### The Explanation When you set
                    `position: fixed;` on an element, it is taken out of the
                    normal flow of the document. This means the next element in
                    the HTML (your ``) behaves as if the header isn't there and
                    starts from the very top of the page, causing the overlap.
                    While you have a `margin-top: 40px;` on your `section`, the
                    header's height might be larger than that, still causing
                    some of the content to be obscured. ### The Solution The
                    common practice to solve this is to add padding to the top
                    of the to push all the content down by an amount equal to or
                    greater than the height of the fixed header.
